# Idea
This is an addition to my last assignment which was a variation of Conway's Game of Life. I have added shaders to the code to add a black and white filter and also distort the whole canvas. I have also increased the grid to show a 2x2 grid of the Game of Life code. I did not have a clear vision going into this, as to what I wanted to add to this piece. As I am new to coding shaders, I mostly messed around with what I could do with this piece and ended up masking the color and creating a wave distortion to the canvas. I think the distortion adds a bit of interesting movement and the black and white makes it look a lot like tv static. By changing the grid size, as well as the distortion speed, you can change the look and feel of the piece.
