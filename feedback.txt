Xin Zhang: 
a. I like the black and white pixels on the canvas. And also the effect of those grids It randomly
disappears
b. I saw there are 4 parts in the canvas, which they are all disappear in the same way. It would be
better If those 4 parts can be shown in a different way.
c. Creating a visual grid overlay and converting the colors to a modified “black and white”
d. The use of random colors and transparency for alive cells further enhances the visual appeal,
making the simulation more vibrant and less predictable
